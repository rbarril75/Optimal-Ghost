Optimal-Ghost
=============

Implementation of the Ghost word game. Users play against a computer that uses an optimal winning algorithm.

TODO: The computer doesn't always extend the game as long as possible if it knows it will lose. Not essential to the algorithm but will fix anyway.

TODO: Refactor heavily.
